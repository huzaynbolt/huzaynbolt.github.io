                           <h3>GENERAL</h3>
                           <p>You confirm that you are at least 18 years of age or are accessing the Site under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian. You agree that if you are unsure of the meaning of any part of the Terms and Conditions of Sale, you will not hesitate to contact us for clarification prior to making a purchase.</p>
                           <p>These Terms and Conditions of Sale fully govern the sale of goods and services purchased on this Site. No extrinsic evidence, whether oral or written, will be incorporated.</p>

                           <h3>FORMATION OF CONTRACT</h3>
                           <p>Both parties agree that browsing the website and gathering information regarding the services provided by the seller does not constitute an offer to sell, but merely an invitation to treat. The parties accept that an offer is only made once you have selected the item you intend to engage with or purchase, chosen your preferred payment method, proceeded to the checkout and completed the checkout process.</p>
                           <p>Both parties agree that the acceptance of the offer is not made when the seller contacts you by phone or by email to confirm that the order has been placed online. Your offer is only accepted when we dispatch the product to you or inform you either by email or by phone of the dispatch of your ordered product, or when you access the product, service or program.</p>
                           <p>Before your order is confirmed, you may be asked to provide additional verifications or information, including but not limited to phone number and address, before we accept the order.</p>
                           <p>Please note that there are cases when an order cannot be processed for various reasons. The Site reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason at any given time.</p>

                           <h3>ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS</h3>
                           <p>You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>

                           <h3>PAYMENT AND PRICING</h3>
                           <p>We are determined to provide the most accurate pricing information on the Site to our users; however, errors may still occur, such as cases when the price of an item is not displayed correctly on the website. As such, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order. In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our own discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.</p>
                           <p>We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit/debit card charged. In the event that we are unable to provide the services, we will inform you of this as soon as possible. A full refund will be given where you have already paid for the products.</p>

                           <h3>USE OF VOUCHER CODES</h3>
                           <p>Our Site accepts the use of voucher codes for orders placed online. The marketing voucher codes which are accepted on our Site entitle you at the time of ordering a product to a saving on the order being placed on our Site. Vouchers may also be issued to customers in exchange for advance payments made to us via transfer to our bank accounts for products intended to be purchased on the Site.</p>
                           <p>Our voucher codes may not be exchanged for cash. With the exception of vouchers issued in accordance with our refunds policy and vouchers issued in exchange for advance payments, we reserve the right to cancel or withdraw our voucher codes at any time.</p>

                           <h3>LIABILITY OF PARTIES ON THE SAEDCONNECT MARKETPLACE</h3>
                           <p>We also operate a marketplace which is open for third-parties to sell their products on our website. None of the products listed on the SAEDConnect Marketplace are owned or sold by us, neither are we involved in the actual sale transaction between the buyers and sellers on the SAEDConnect Marketplace.</p>
                           <p>The buyer and seller agree that we would be held free from any liability in contract, pre-contract or other representations in tort, for all transactions conducted on the SAEDConnect Marketplace.</p>

                           <h3>DELIVERY</h3>
                           <p>This Site may offer delivery of products to customers within Nigeria. We make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timescales set out on our Site; however delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen factors. We shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver the products within the estimated timescales where they did not occur due to our fault or negligence.</p>
                           <p>You agree not to hold the seller liable for any delay or failure to deliver products or otherwise perform any obligation as specified in these Terms and Conditions of Sale if the same is wholly or partly caused whether directly or indirectly by circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</p>

                           <h3>INDEMNITY</h3>
                           <p>You agree to indemnify us, our affiliates, officers, directors, agents and/or employees, as the case may be, free from any claim or demand, including reasonable legal fees, related to your breach of these Terms and Conditions of Sale.</p>

                           <h3>APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3>
